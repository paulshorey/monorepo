### Q:  
How to get to beautiful words like "monde" ?  
It has rare synonyms, so would not show up in reverse-search !  
### A:  
Perhaps Full-Text search of ${row.list.toString()}  
Searching "cafe" "best" "people" "elite" would then find "monde"  
        For this search, perhaps prefer "rare" words like this,  
        which have not too many, and not too few list_count (10-20)  
  
  
### Tagging query:  
  
nnn - keep maximum 2 last nouns  
  
aan - keep maximum 1 last adjective  
  
?n - preceding noun is usually noun/pronoun/adjective  
  
?a - preceding adjective is usually adjective  
  
  
### Building phrase:  
  
"smug mug" ~ find somewhat related words (3 steps away) which contain each other  
  
don't change 1-2-letter words! use as is  
don't use phrases, until have a good usecase
