# design agency  
    (2004-2005 - 3rd/4th year high school)  
  
In high school, I wanted to make an design agency (freelance web / graphics) business,  
by collecting designs/photographs/websites from various obscure sources online,  
and claiming them to be my own work, in order to get contracts. I would just "wing it",  
would learn to make each product later, as I get each client/contract.  
I had the basic skills, just needed more practice. So this could have actually worked!  
  
Decided it was not a good idea to be dishonest,  
even though now I realize that this is the business plan of most startups!  
  
Went to art school instead, to get some skills and practice.  
Would execute this idea in the future, but with my own portfolio, and actual skills.

# UserFriendlyCMS.com, ArtSpaces.net  
### web design / development agency, for artists and small businesses  
    (2008-2009 - 3rd/4th year college)  
  
While in art school, I was wondering how to pay my bills and loans...  
but people kept asking me to make them a website. So, I taught myself PHP + HTML.  
  
Made a CMS admin tool, fully-featured with photo/video uploads, resizing, web server,  
and even basic e-commerce integration (prices, quantities, PayPal links).  
  
It included custom styles and templates - much like Squarespace or Shopify,  
before that was a thing! This was a good user-friendly Content Mangement System  
even before Wordpress had a user-friendly UI.  
  
Unfortunately, my custom platform was not easy enough to copy/paste for a new site,  
and I made each new site completely custom from scratch, which took a long time.  
  
What's worse, is I realized that artists and small local businesses did not want  
or were not able to pay good money for this difficult custom design/development work.  
  
This could have worked as a SAAS product, if I used a generic template,  
instead of custom development for each site. Then I could charge a small monthly fee,  
and no upfront fee. I could have gotten many more clients, and scaled much faster!  
But, I did not have the technical or business skills to accomplish this at the time.

# aerial photography drone  
    (2012-2013 - 3rd/4th year first career job)  
  
After a lot of struggling, figuring out soldering/wires/motors and aerodynamics,  
I developed the best aerial photography rig. This drone could carry a mirror-less DLSR,  
and fly for 25 min, through high gusty winds, high altitude, while staying very steady.  
  
I kept crashing and breaking things, and never quite perfected it. Came close a few times!  
  
In hind-sight, it is obvious now that I was very naive and reckless, trying to engineer  
this complicated contraption first from a small NYC apartment, then even worse, while  
traveling, on the road, from hotel rooms and campgrounds! Of course things malfunctioned!  
  
If I got it to work, I could have been hired by high-end real-estate, or resort properties,  
because the photo/video quality was a few years ahead of its time. But it was taking too long.

# AngularCMS, photo gallery, small freelance contracts  
    (2014)  
  
After losing my 5-year job as a lead web developer, primarily doing HTML/CSS, and some jQuery,  
I was in a world of pain and confusion, trying to learn actual programming. As an experiment,  
I re-built my original software, UserFriendlyCMS.com, in AngularJS. Still PHP on the backend.  
Also created a full-screen, pretty nifty photo gallery / slideshow, again thinking along the  
same lines - to re-launch ArtSpaces.net as a professional photographer-focused "Squarespaces".  
Also took small jobs. Designed/developed CarteBlancheJazzBand.com, ShienCosmetics.com. Worked  
a few months on iRokoTV, a Nigerian "Netflix" type service. All good learning experiences!  
  
##  
# AllEvents.nyc  
    (2016)  
  
Data mining, and aggregation, to combine multiple sources into one. A website of all events  
happening in NYC. Mostly culture/art/tech events, because there are already aggregators  
for sports and mainstream music performances.  
  
I noticed that I did not have the programming skills to make a good scalable platform.  
  
Also, the business plan was not vetted. I did not have the rights to use any of this content,  
because it mostly came from online newspapers and magazines.  
  
Although, it could have worked, if the technology platform scaled better, because it would be  
easy to include more sources, from each venue. Then I would have been able to get permission  
(and even payment) form each venue, instead of relying on 3rd party events sites.  
  
##  
# JsJobs.us, TechJobs.us  
    (2018)  
  
Just like AllEvents.nyc, but for tech job listings.  
  
Would have monetized through a small monthly subscription fee for visitors.  
Could have also integrated lucrative Recruitment Agency referral commissions.  
  
Again, was not able to engineer a scalable and easy to maintain technology platform for  
web scraping, data aggregation, and web publishing. Found myself a promising job, instead.

# NameBrain.ai, NLPThesaurus.com  
    (2019-2020)  
  
Domain name suggestions. Powered by the world's best thesaurus API, and some clever algorithms.  
  
### B2B / SAAS:  
The more immediate plan, more lucrative, less hassle. 100 registars out there, looking to increase  
their conversion rate, and get people to buy more domains. What better way than to give their  
visitors more useful alternatives. When a "specific query .com" is not available, suggest available  
alternatives. Then the user is likely to buy some domain, rather than just walk dissapointed.  
  
There are 1000 domain extensions now, and buyers don't even know what their options are.  
The registrar can subscribe to get 1) extensions suggestions 2) alternative domain names 3) both  
  
### RapidAPI:  
Post the APIs on rapidapi.com, where anyone from all over the world will be able to subscribe  
instantly, without having to go through sales channels and legal contracts.  
  
They can use access our data right away, and, we get paid right away!  
  
### B2C:  
Web and mobile app. Help consumers (free) and pro users (subscription) find available domain names.  
Monetized by affiliate links (consumers), and subscription fee (pro users).  
  
Has potential to become popular. Unfortunately, referral commissions are low, 0.05%,  
and not many people (domainers, freelancers, name agencies) will subscribe to the paid plans, so  
this B2C is not first choice business plan. Rather, it is intended as a supplemental source of income.  
  
### What's different this time ? Why may this succeed when previous ideas have failed?  
  
1) real business plan: with a clear path to monetization, and multiple sources of revenue  
  
2) much more effort, and much better code! Before, I was working while vacationing, while relaxing.  
This time, I was motivated to worked every evening and weekend, until my eyes, hands, or mind hurt.  
Instead of spending a few months part time, this time I've spent 1 year part time, plus 3 months full time.  
I am now a much better programmer, and can not only write features faster, but can organize and architecture  
code more efficiently, so it scales better, and is easier to maintain and adapt to future changes.  
My wife quit medical school to hustle with me. There is a lot more to a successful business than programming.  
She does a lot of the content, design, and research. Together we are a more well-rounded and capable team.  
  
3) intellectual property! We own and control our own data, and have invented some very useful algorithms.
