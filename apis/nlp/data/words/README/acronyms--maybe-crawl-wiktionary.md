# Use Wiktionary to ignore CAPITALIZED short words like:  
  
led  
usd  
ipo  
seo  
ui  
ux  
lol  
omg  
  
But Wiktionary also wants to capitalize non-abbreviations like:  
  
art (8 links)  
tin (5 links)  
top (4 links)  
  
This does not solve certain problematic words like "ing", but those should be few and unimportant.  
  
SOLUTION:  
  
    IGNORE WORD if Wiktionary  
  
        ((has ((3) or fewer) links) to it, and one of them is UPPERCASE)  
        or links to it directly: "Did you mean IRL?"
