  
## PROBLEM: "woman" includes "cleaning"  
    SOLUTION:  
    "cleaning" is an adjective. "woman" is clearly a noun. Removing adjectives from results will help all words anyway.  
  
## PROBLEM: "yorker" looks good on specs, but terrible results  
    SOLUTION:  
    Add a functionality to clear out all results for a word. So it can still be used for wordBreak, but not for synonyms.  
    OR AT LEAST,  
    Combine results from .alt word (in this case would be "york"), for "insurance" against this sort of nonesense
