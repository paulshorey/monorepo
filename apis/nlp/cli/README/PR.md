### LOL. This is a work in progress:  
  
I've been working professionally for 12 years now, and have been getting pretty good at Javascript and UI development.  
  
Recently, I've been empowered by the increasing maturity of NodeJS ecosystem. At the same time, I've been inspired by the lack of good responsive UI/UX design in commercial apps (like Airbnb, Microsoft office, Apple, GitNote, Atlassian, and EverNote). Many web companies seemingly ignore the user's perspective when designing their apps. In my own professional and corporate jobs, our products have usually been not only engineered but also designed by the programmers. I have consistently been the sole designer for the product I am programming. That is unfortunate, because even though I enjoy design, it's hard to do a great job if I'm also expected to keep up with Jira tickets and everchanging requirements. If tech departments are like this in other companies, then no wonder why their user experience is lacking.  
  
So, I decided that it may not be such a crazy idea to create something of my own - with full creative license - to execute my vision without being dragged down by tedious coding conventions, without jumping through hoops to please my Scrum master, without having to make compromises because everyone on the team does not share the same vision and we don't have time to make good UI designs or data science models necessary for everyone to share the vision.  
  
We are now a team, a husband and wife team, plus reliable freelance programmers in Eastern Europe. My wife, Samira, helps a lot with UI/UX design, social, and business decisions. I Paul Shorey, am the CTO, responsible for structuring the flow of data-science, to back-end dev-ops, to front-end integration. I code in NodeJS, ReactJS, and Bash (for server and AI automation). We occasionally hire out work that I am less proficient in, such as GoLang, to freelance professionals. I then review their code, make sure it's legible, maintainable, and scalable, and integrate it into my back-end. This tiny team is so far working out very efficiently. We have excellent communication and set our goals in small attainable chunks. More importantly, we have no overhead or beaurocracy of a large corporation to slow us down. I personally focus on the quality and clarity of every line of code being written. We have no Scrum process or hard deadlines, so no pressure to cut corners. As a result of all this, WordSalad.ai is coming out very successfully, and on time.  
  
More importantly, every step of the process is modular. The content-collection, data-extraction, data-filtering, tokenization, pos-tagging, name-suggestions, client-integration, back-end infrastructure, front-end apps - are independent, unique code-bases. Each has its own requirements, version control, and a clearly documented API. Each "module" is easy to manage, easy to maintain because of its limited complexity. This helps us be very efficient and not get bogged down by "code debt". Each module can be assigned to a different freelancer for help without divulging the company's entire intellectual-property.  
  
We are now proud to present the "Alpha" release of Word Salad AI. It is already the most powerful domain-name and business-name suggestion tool on the market, and is a quite powerful NLP (Natural Language Processing) engine capable of tokenizing, tagging, and ascribing meaning to words, phrases, and in the near future hopefully even complete sentences, which is today only achievable by the leading tech companies. We are constantly improving the algorithm based on your searches and suggestions, refining the results, removing any unintelligible or offensive suggestions, and improving the accuracy of our POS (part of speech) detection.  
  
Try it out! You've never used anything quite like it (and if you have, please tell us about it):  
  
    [ link to (RAPID API) ]  
  
    Pricing:  
    [ trial ] free up to 200 requests per month, then $0.02 per request  
    [ pay-per-use ] $0.01 per request  
  
Please subscribe to be notified of its "Beta" release in January 2020, and the "Enterprise" software soon after. We are packaging this web service as an enterprise-level product which can be executed and run on your web server directly, without the overhead of external HTTP requests. You will not need to install and configure anything, and all OS and hardware are supported. Just run the executable on system startup and your developers will be able to communicate with it via HTTP requests over localhost - same as a normal API but without any latency. The RapidAPI endpoints will still be available if you do not need this option.

    [x] Notify me once when RapidAPI is upgraded to "Beta" version, then again when it is available for "Enterprise" integration.  
    [x] Besides this one-time notification, also add me to the monthly newsletter which will have interesting English business-name suggestions, new domain-extension releases, and significant improvements to WordSalad.ai engine.  
  
We are also working fast to create and publish this service as a mobile (Android and iPhone) app, and to improve the current web UI. This client app will feature automatic search of hundreds of suggestions, to give the user (you) many unique web domain suggestions which are available to purchase. More importantly, it will search up to 1,000 domain names, which are related and synonyms of the phrase you typed. So, you will get domain extension suggestions perfect for your business (like ".gourmet", ".gallery", ".llc", ".lawyer", ".farm") instead of just ".com". Besides quality suggestions, it will utilize a unique UI, never seen before in an app like this, for building phrases from parts of speech by selecting and combining adjectives, nouns, before/after words, suffixes, prefixes etc.  
  
This will always remain a free service, to showcase the API, give end users the power to discover useful domain name alternatives, and to generate revenue for us via affiliate commisions from domain registrars (at no added cost to our users).
